# Topic Modeling

We apply Topic Modeling to Analyze a corpus of Amazon reviews:

1. Load in the Amazon Review dataset

2. Clean the dataset

3. Vectorize the dataset

4. Fit a Gensim LDA topic model on Amazon Reviews

5. Select appropriate number of topics

6. Create some dope visualization of the topics

7. We write a few bullets on the findings in markdown at the end
